GO:0000453	This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function. consider: GO:0006364
GO:0005451	This term was obsoleted because it represents an unnecessary grouping term.
GO:0006295	This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function. replaced by: GO:0006289
GO:0006296	This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function    replaced by: GO:0006289
GO:0006875	This is an unnecessary grouping class.replaced by: GO:0030003
GO:0008022	It is out of GO scope. replaced by: GO:0005515
GO:0008852	This term was obsoleted because it is the same function as single-stranded DNA 3'-5' exodeoxyribonuclease activity ; GO:0008310. replaced by: GO:0008310
GO:0008853	This term was obsoleted because it is the same function as double-stranded DNA 3'-5' exodeoxy ribonuclease activity ; GO:0008311. replaced by: GO:0008311
GO:0015298	OBSOLETE. Enables the transfer of a solute or solutes from one side of a membrane to the other according to the reaction: solute(out) + cation(in) = solute(in) + cation(out).
GO:0015299	OBSOLETE. Enables the transfer of a solute or solutes from one side of a membrane to the other according to the reaction: solute(out) + H+(in) = solute(in) + H+(out).

GO:0031997	It is beyond GO scope. replaced by: GO:0005515
GO:0032199	This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function. replaced by: GO:0032197
GO:0033501	This term was obsoleted because it does not specify whether it represent an intracellular or an organism-level process. consider: GO:0033502
GO:0033561	This term was obsoleted because it represents a readout. consider: GO:0043589, consider: GO:0098773

GO:0055065	This is an unnecessary grouping class. consider: GO:0030003
GO:0055069	The reason for obsoletion is that the term is not clearly defined and usage has been inconsistent. For homeostasis terms, we would like to specify whether the homeostasis takes place intracellularly or at the level of the organism. consider: GO:0006882, consider: GO:0180002
GO:0055076	This is an unnecessary grouping class. consider: GO:0030003

GO:0097273	This term was obsoleted because this process does not exist: creatinine is a waste product, there are no biological processes to maintain its level, although some mutants accumulate excesses. consider: GO:0003014
GO:0097274	This term was obsoleted because this process does not exist: urea is a waste product, there are no biological processes to maintain its level, although some mutants accumulate excesses. consider: GO:0003014
GO:0140323	This term was obsoleted because it is an unnecessary grouping class.
